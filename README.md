This repo presents the codes applied to data generation on the work "Optimal complexity of parameterized quantum circuits", GIC, P. C. Azado, D. O. Soares-Pinto, G. G. Carlo.

Folders Entanglement, Expressibility and Lorenz Curves PQCs present the codes applied to the Parameterized Circuits. The folder randomcircuit_G3 studies the Entanglement, Expressibility and Lorenz Curves of the universal G3 class of circuits in the Standard form (random application of gates with uniform sampling over qubits and gates).
Additionally, the two codes in the main folder present the codes applied in the Appendix, where the G2 and G3 circuits are investigated applying random one qubit gates followed by dense arrangements of CNOT gates.
